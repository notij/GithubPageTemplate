# GithubPageTemplate

A template for building a personal or project GitHub Pages site with Splatoon-style theming, custom cursors, and optional hobby/records sections.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Main page (about, publications, awards). Replace placeholders with your info.
- `hobby.html` – Optional hobby/extra content page. Edit sections and add your content.
- `static/` – CSS, fonts, images (cursors, media icons), and JS. Keep paths as-is when editing.
- `static/records/` – Optional: put images or PDFs here and link them from hobby.html (e.g. running logs, screenshots).

## Quick start

1. Clone or download this template.
2. Replace "Your Name" and "Your Title / Tagline" in `index.html` and `hobby.html`.
3. Fill in About Me, Publication, and Awards in `index.html`.
4. Edit hobby sections in `hobby.html` and add any records under `static/records/` if needed.
5. Enable GitHub Pages for your repo (Settings → Pages → source: main branch).
